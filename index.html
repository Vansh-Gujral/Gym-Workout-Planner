    <p>Eating a healthy diet is essential for overall health and well-being, and it can also help you reach your fitness goals. Here are some nutrition tips to follow:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables are packed with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, which are essential for good health. Aim to eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables each day.</li>
      <li>Choose whole grains over refined grains. Whole grains are a good source of fiber, which can help you feel full and satisfied after eating. Refined grains have been stripped of their fiber and nutrients, so they are not as healthy.</li>
      <li>Choose lean protein sources. Lean protein sources, such as chicken, fish, beans, and tofu, are low in saturated fat and calories. They are also a good source of essential amino acids, which are needed for muscle growth and repair.</li>
      <li>Limit unhealthy fats. Unhealthy fats, such as saturated and trans fats, can raise cholesterol levels and increase your risk of heart disease. Limit your intake of saturated and trans fats by choosing lean protein sources, low-fat dairy products, and healthy oils, such as olive oil and avocado oil.</li>
      <li>Drink plenty of water. Water is essential for good health, and it can also help you feel full and satisfied. Aim to drink eight glasses of water each day.</li>
